SOON:
 - fix client!
 - invert board in the web client too, to make it consistent with the game
   (otherwise, games played against the command-line client have different
    history in the web client compared to the game log)

index.html:
 - (low prio): after creating a game, should add keys to the URL parameters
   to fix the back/reload keys.

client/client.go:
 - rate limit polling

server/static/game.js:
 - maybe: support multiple board sizes? (requires lots of server changes too!)
 - calculate and visualize valid moves
   (do I already get them from the server?)

server/server.go:
 - implement DataStore for storing games
   (use Redis on Heroku)
 - either fix Heroku support or remove related files
