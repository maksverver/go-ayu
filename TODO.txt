client/client.go:
 - rate limit polling

server/static/game.js:
 - maybe: support multiple board sizes? (requires lots of server changes too!)
 - calculate and visualize valid moves
   (do I already get them from the server?)

server/server.go:
 - implement DataStore for storing games
   (use Redis on Heroku)
 - either fix Heroku support or remove related files
